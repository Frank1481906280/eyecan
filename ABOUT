   This product includes software developed at
   Project eyeCan (http://eyecanproject.wordpress.com/) by members of Forge 
   as the first project of Samsung CLAB.

   Portions of this software (eye-tracker, calibrator, camera settings, etc)
   were developed at EyeWriter project (http://www.eyewriter.org/).
   We appreciate the wonderful work by Free Art and Technology (FAT), 
   OpenFrameworks and the Graffiti Resarch Lab: Tempt1, Evan Roth, Chris Sugrue,
   Zach Lieberman,Theo Watson, James Powderly and The Ebeling Group.

   This software is based on openFrameworks v0.062 so anybody who wants
   to compile may locate the appropriate version of openFrameworks under
   the folder named of_vs.

   This software contains codes as listed below:
   - ofxCvGrayscaleAdvanced by Stefanix and Zach
